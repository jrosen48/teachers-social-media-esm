Teachers selected to participate will be asked to complete two short surveys each week over four weeks (eight surveys total), and may be asked to record a short video reflection.  The surveys will take less than 3 minutes to complete and will focus on what social networks and other online resources teachers use to help them teach. 
Participants will receive a $50 Amazon gift card for their participation. If interested, please complete the following recruitment form, and feel free to share it with your colleagues.
